# Schoil Mhuire Milford Website (frontend)

The site frontend is hosted and automatically built using Netlify and a webhook provided by the Sanity backend, or when changes are pushed into the `master` branch of this repository.

The Sanity Studio interface can be found at https://scoilmhuire.sanity.studio/ to manage content - the site automatically rebuilds upon content changes.
